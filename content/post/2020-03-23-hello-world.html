<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is my “blog”. And by blog, I mean a place where I might post things I write. We’ll see if/when I actually do that.</p>
<p>Possible posts you can, but probably shouldn’t, expect from me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summaries of papers (mostly as a way to help me remember them)</li>
<li>Code for how I did something in R</li>
<li>Other assorted writings/notes to help me organize my thoughts on a topic</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Hello world!&quot;</code></pre>
