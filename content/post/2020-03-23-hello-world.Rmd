Hello!

This is my "blog". And by blog, I mean a place where I might post things I write. We'll see if/when I actually do that. 

Possible posts you can, but probably shouldn't, expect from me:

- Summaries of papers (mostly as a way to help me remember them)
- Code for how I did something in R
- Other assorted writings/notes to help me organize my thoughts on a topic

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```
