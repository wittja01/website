I am not currently teaching any courses. I am interested in teaching courses on the following subjects:
- General biology (ecology/evolution focused preferably)
- General entomology
- Forest entomology
- R programming
- Biostatistics/Statistics
- Open and reproducible science

In the future, I may post example syllabi for courses I could teach.
