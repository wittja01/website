abstract: The emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera Buprestidae) is an invasive woodboring beetle native to northeastern Asia that continues to expand its range within North America and European Russia. The insect reproduces within and kills most North American species of ash Fraxinus spp. Because both the adult and larval life stages of EAB are difficult to detect prior to development of tree symptoms, much work has focused on quantifying spread and clarifying the potential movement pathways to improve early detection and monitoring strategies. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed county‚Äêlevel infestations of emerald ash borer in the state of Iowa, U.S.A., subsequent to the initial detection of EAB in 2010. Visual data analysis had suggested that new infestations were not in accordance with the expected patterns of establishment along roads, near campgrounds or by large population centres. We found a positive correlation between the establishment and detection of EAB in Iowa counties and the length of railroads in each county. To our knowledge, this is the first statistically significant association between rail pathways and the spread of EAB on the North American continent.
