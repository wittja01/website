abstract: Many jewel beetles (Coleoptera Buprestidae) play an important ecological role in wood decomposition and nutrient cycling. Compared with other saproxylic species, buprestids are considered cryptic as they are difficult to sample and identify. As a result, factors that influence buprestid diversity and distribution are poorly understood. This is especially true in urban forests, which may be unique fragmented and contain unique species distributions. We utilized the native ground nesting hunting wasp Cerceris fumipennis to survey buprestids at 20 urban sites in Minnesota, USA. We collected a total of 1,939 beetles consisting of 11 genera and 51 species, including 10 new state records for the state of Minnesota. Agrilus was the most common genus collected, followed by Dicerca. Species richness tended to decrease in sites with many emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (EAB), which may reflect a potential tendency of wasps to return preferentially to high density infestations of EAB. We found buprestid species richness positively correlated with site-level variables such as the number of dead trees within a 200 m radius around each C. fumipennis nesting site. Positive correlations between certain buprestid species and a number of tree genera offer new insights into potential host associations in this understudied family. Our work illustrates how C. fumipennis can be utilized for general buprestid surveys in urban areas to better understand the distribution of this cryptic family.
